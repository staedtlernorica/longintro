Hey there, I'm Long, a front end developer from Toronto, and a recent grad from Juno College's Web Deb Bootcamp. 

I love using web technologies to solve everyday problems and simplify small daily interactions to make life easier. My tech stack indludes HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/jQuery, React, Git, Firebase and Python. I'm also familiar with API's, such as REST, or dedicated tools like the Youtube API v3.

I'm currently learning Vue.js, as well as looking for full-time opportunities to work on applications that positively impacts users. You can see an overview of all my projects at my [portfolio](https://longvuong.ca), as well ways to get in touch with me.
