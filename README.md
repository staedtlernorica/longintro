Hey there, I'm Long, a front end developer with a background in statistics and life sciences. I love to create fun and useful apps, especially if that app can make the user's day more convenient. I often find inspiration for these apps from my own daily small inconveniences. 

I have experience building accessible, intuitive web applications with HTML/CSS/JS, SCSS, jQuery, React, Firebase, Python and Git (wouldn't it be funny if I'm on GitHub but didn't know how to use Git?) I also have experience working with API, wireframing, and pair programming.
